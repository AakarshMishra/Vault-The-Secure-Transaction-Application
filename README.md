# VAULT-THE FULLY SECURE TRANSACTION APP
VAULT, a revolutionary payment gateway, tackles growing cybersecurity concerns in financial transactions. Its robust security architecture prioritizes user data protection.
VAULT utilizes a three-factor login to significantly reduce unauthorized access. Sensitive KYC data is secured with TriSecurEncrypt, a novel algorithm leveraging a combination of established encryption techniques: AES for confidentiality, RSA for secure key exchange, and HMAC for data integrity. Additionally, steganography further safeguards user information by concealing it within images.
For financial transactions, VAULT employs specialized encryption protocols, ensuring the confidentiality of credit card details, debit card information, and bills. Even password recovery prioritizes security with two-factor authentication via one-time passwords (OTPs).
By offering a comprehensive suite of security features, VAULT aims to establish itself as the new standard for secure and user-friendly digital transactions.
